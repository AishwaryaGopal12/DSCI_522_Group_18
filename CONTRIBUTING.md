All contributions to this project are welcome. Listed below are the set of guidelines for contributing to this project.

### Filing Issues
Prior to creating a pull request, file an issue and ensure that someone from the team agrees that it's an issue. In case of a bug, create an issue with a minimum reproducible example.

### Pull Request Process

- We recommend that you create a Git branch for every pull request.
- New R code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
- We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html), with [Markdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html) syntax, for documentation.
- We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html). Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
- We use the PEP8 style guide for Python code.

We will review pull requests within 7 days.
