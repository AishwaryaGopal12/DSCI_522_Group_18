### Introduction
This is the Code of Conduct for group 18 of DSCI 522. Our group are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for collaborating and communicating. 
All participants in our group and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. 
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to our group, including, but not limited to, weekly meetings, email communication, and online conversations over Slack Channel and GitHub. Every member of our team are expected to follow and assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

### The Code of Conduct for Group 18
Our group is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

#### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all our events and platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

#### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any event/platform of our group include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to all group events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, any member in this group may warn the offender and or engage the DSCI 522 Instructor to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

### Incident Reporting Guidelines

If someone violates the Code of Conduct during an event or in an online space, we ask that you report it to our team members. Our team members are Aishwarya Gopal, Fei Chang, and Yanhua Chen. An email to 522-group-18-aaaacxr3h73klw7fmuwqa2em6m@ubc-mds.slack.com, will be seen by us. To report a code of conduct violation that you believe should not be seen by our group members, you may directly contact Tiffany Timbers, the Instructor of the course 522. Her email is tiffany.timbers@stat.ubc.ca.
